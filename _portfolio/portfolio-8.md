This project is a small application that automatically emails me AI news daily at 5:30pm ready for when I get home. It is written in Python and is hosted on PythonAnywhere. PythonAnywhere is the scheduler that run the code every day at the allocated time. The email side of things is done using google applications, utilising the google SMTP.

Example of automatic email while testing:
