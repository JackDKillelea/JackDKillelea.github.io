In this project, I wanted to learn about reinforcement learning algorithms and I believe I manage to do this, and this is probably one of the most fun projects I have done so far in python. Although, I do believe I still have a lot of learning to do on this subject. 

The project is built in python, using the OpenAI Gym framework to pull a game and display it on screen. I think use numpy to store the data gathered from the game being ran. Once the AI module has finished running, I then plot the rewards to a graph using matplotlib to see how much it has improved (or not in some cases). 

I expect there to be a few more projects like this soon, hopefully getting harder and harder.
