To streamline my search for a new graphics card, I developed a web scraper in Python. 
This project, my first foray into Python programming, leverages the BeautifulSoup library to 
extract relevant information from a target website.

While this initial iteration focuses on a single website, I plan to expand its functionality to encompass 
multiple online retailers, enabling comprehensive price comparison and deal discovery. 
I consider this first attempt a successful foundation for future development.
