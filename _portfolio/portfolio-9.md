This project showcases a understanding of both motion detection and thread managment. It was created with Python using cv2 (the opencv library) for webcam integration and motion detection. 

In this project I built upon what I knew about email sending and started using a new (in my opinion easier) way to send emails. I also learnt about threading and thread management to stop the main thread from handing when sending the email.
