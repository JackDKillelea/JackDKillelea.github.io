In this project, I wanted to learn about creating a GUI with python, I also checked out [this website](https://dailypythonprojects.substack.com/) and saw in their level 3 projects to make a [drawing app.](https://dailypythonprojects.substack.com/p/drawing-app-with-tkinter) so I decided to give it a try. 


I believe there is still a lot of work to be done on this project, but this is a very basic implementation to get a better understanding and nail the framework. I will probably expand on this in the future with the following additions:
1. Create a second colour option (similar to Paint).
2. Have some preset brush size options.
3. Create different brushes.
4. Make the UI buttons looks a little less 1998.
