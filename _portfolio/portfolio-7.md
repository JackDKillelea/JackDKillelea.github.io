This project showcases a simple understanding of both Python web development and csv to pdf manipulation. It was created with the Streamlit framework using Pandas for the csv manipulation. Leveraging Streamlit's rapid prototyping capabilities, this application provides a streamlined user interface for managing tasks efficiently.

The csv you want to provide takes in an Order, Topic and Blank Pages, so you're CSV will look something like:
1,Fruit,3
2,Chocolates,1

Then you should get the output of a PDF with the Topic as the header and the amount of blank pages after the header. This is useful for note taking in university for example.
