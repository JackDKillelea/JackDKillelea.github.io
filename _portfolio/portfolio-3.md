This project presents a VR platform experience, allowing users to explore a virtual 
terrain from a seated platform. Predefined linear movements guide the user through the environment.

A demonstration video showcasing the platform's functionality can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6d796LMrz4) 

Please note that the mouse movements visible in the video are for demonstration purposes only, simulating the intended VR headset controls. The project is fully compatible with VR headsets.
