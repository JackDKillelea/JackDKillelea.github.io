Motivated by a desire to combine my passion for gaming with my coding skills, I developed a fully functional, modular inventory system. This system, designed for integration into RPG-style games, offers the following features:

**Item Management**: Add and remove items, simulating quest rewards or other in-game events.
**Inventory Toggle**: Open and close the inventory UI.
**Informative Tooltips**: Display item details (tooltips) on hover.
**Dynamic Inventory Sizing**: Supports a flexible number of inventory slots, defaulting to a standard RPG inventory size of 24.
**Item Drag and Drop**: Allows players to rearrange items within the inventory, including swapping held items with those in occupied slots.

This project's modular design allows for easy adaptation to various RPG projects. Simple modifications to textures, colors, item assets, and the item database enable seamless integration into different game environments.

The inventory system was developed using Unity and C#. The source code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/JackDKillelea/Inventory_System
