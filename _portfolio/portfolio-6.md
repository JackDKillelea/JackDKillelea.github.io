This project showcases a simple web based portfolio developed with Python and the Streamlit framework, I have not deployed this website because I am currently using github pages as my portfolio. Leveraging Streamlit's rapid prototyping capabilities, this application provides a streamlined user interface for managing tasks efficiently.

This website also has a contact page, that when you press the "Contact Me" button at the bottom, it will fire off an email to my email address. This is done using google applications, utilising the google SMTP.

The source code is available here for review. I plan to update this as I make new items and once it is looking a bit better, possibly host it as my github pages portfolio instead of this website.
