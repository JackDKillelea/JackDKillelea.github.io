This project showcases a minimalist to-do web application developed with Python and the Streamlit framework, deployed on Streamlit Cloud. Leveraging Streamlit's rapid prototyping capabilities, this application provides a streamlined user interface for managing tasks efficiently.

The source code is available here for review. Future enhancements could include features such as task prioritization, deadlines and possibly instanced tasks using a database as they are currently global.
